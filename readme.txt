= 1.1.5 - 2013/03/25 =
* Fix - Lightbox pop-up script bug. When using the Lightbox tool for the image pop-up the current image did not show - instead showed first image in the gallery. Could never resolve this so we have replaced the old Lightbox pop-up script with new Colorbox script. This fixes this long standing issue. 
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing a -1 to show in the Gallery Container instead of the current image because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Dynamic Gallery will automatically detect that and works as it should.

If you have not upgraded to WordPress 3.5 do not install this plugin upgrade until you do or the image pop-up won't work for you. Note WooCommerce 2.0 requires WordPress 3.5.
* Feature - On install Dynamic Gallery can now show product feature images that have been created from the WordPress Media Library. Previously the gallery could not find these images and would show no image.

* Tweak - Dynamic Gallery now only recognizes image formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. It won't recognize another file and won't show in gallery, or on Image gallery manager meta box. Mean that files like PDF's can be uploaded and the gallery does not show them or on the Pro version create variations for them in the pop up image manager.
* Tweak - Added link to Dynamic gallery Admin tab for our New WordPress version of WooCommerce Product Widget Slideshow plugin.
* Tweak - Added 'Apply to All' option on Gallery Image manager pop-up - this feature allows PRO Version user to Apply all variations in a set to the selected image with one click - Thanks to Shawn for the feedback and the idea.
